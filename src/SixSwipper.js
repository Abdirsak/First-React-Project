    <p>At First, I didnâ€™t forget my first online shopping. I was 18 years old; I was studying my UG in The American college. I do know much about online shopping. My friend who is ordered a sunglass from online. I ask to him about the price. I was a little surprised that the price is very cheap compared to traditional shopping. Then I planned to shop online.</p>
